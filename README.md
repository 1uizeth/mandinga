# Mandinga Protocol

### *A Permissionless Savings Primitive for Everyone*

*Lightpaper v0.2 — February 2026*

*Mandinga Protocol lives at the intersection of three things: a self-custodial savings account that earns yield from the moment you deposit; a built-in savings circle where anyone saving can join a group and rotate to earn yield on a larger amount than they could reach alone; and a Safety Net Pool that covers up to half your installment when you need it — or from the start if you choose — while you pay a small fee for the coverage. A permissionless savings primitive that keeps saving what it has always been — a collective act, not just an individual one.*

## 1. The Problem

### 1.1 Compounding Is the Most Unequal Force in Finance

Yield on savings is, at its core, a function of capital size and time. The more capital you start with, and the earlier you access a lump sum to put to work, the more you benefit from compounding. This is not a bug — it is the arithmetic of exponential growth. But it means that the wealthiest savers structurally earn the highest returns, not because of superior skill or risk tolerance, but simply because they already have capital.

The person depositing \$50 a month earns yield on \$50. The person who inherited \$50,000 earns yield on \$50,000 from day one. The gap compounds. Over a lifetime, the difference is not marginal — it is the difference between financial precarity and financial stability.

Traditional finance has no answer to this problem. Banks offer savings accounts but apply no mechanism to give smaller savers access to lump-sum capital earlier. Wealth managers serve those who are already wealthy. Microfinance lends at punishing rates. The structural advantage of having capital upfront remains entirely inaccessible to the majority of the world's population.

### 1.2 The World Invented the Answer Thousands of Years Ago

Communities across every continent independently invented the same solution: the rotating savings and credit association. It goes by many names — consórcio in Brazil, chama in East Africa, tanda in Mexico, hui in China, paluwagan in the Philippines, equb in Ethiopia, susu in West Africa, stokvel in South Africa, gye in Korea. The same primitive, invented everywhere humans organised themselves economically.

The mechanic is simple. A group of people contribute a fixed amount regularly. The pooled total rotates to one member per round. Everyone eventually receives the same lump sum — but the member who receives it first gets the compounding advantage of deploying a larger amount earlier. The member who receives it last has effectively saved patiently while others benefited.

What makes this work is not charity. It is solidarity — horizontal, mutual, between equals. The group is the mechanism. The community IS the collateral. No bank. No credit bureau. No identity verification.

According to the World Bank, roughly 25% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa report having used a savings circle. Estimates suggest hundreds of millions of people globally participate in some form of rotating savings. This is not a niche instrument — it is the dominant savings technology for much of humanity.

### 1.3 The Structural Failure Mode

ROSCAs and savings circles have one catastrophic vulnerability: the organiser. In every traditional implementation, one person holds the pot, decides the rotation order, and is trusted by all members not to abscond. When that person disappears — or when an early-payout member stops contributing after receiving the lump sum — the circle collapses. Members waiting for later payouts lose everything they contributed.

This is not a rare edge case. It is the reason ROSCAs remain informal, local, and trust-constrained. You can only participate with people you know personally, in close geographic proximity, with strong social accountability. The social trust that makes them work is also the ceiling that prevents them from scaling.

Every attempt to formalise ROSCAs has tried to solve this with reputation systems, identity verification, or legal enforcement. Each solution imports the exact surveillance and gatekeeping apparatus that makes traditional finance inaccessible to the very people who need savings circles in the first place.

### 1.4 Case Study: What Happened to the Consórcio in Brazil

Brazil offers the clearest and most instructive example of what happens when a solidarity savings primitive is institutionalised — and what it can become when it succeeds. The consórcio — the Brazilian expression of the rotating savings circle — has existed since the 1960s, is regulated by the Banco Central do Brasil, and today reaches over 10 million active participants. By 2025, the sector processed more than $100 billion in credit volume, representing over 6% of Brazilian GDP. Understanding what it became, and how, is not simply a cautionary tale. It is a reflection on a success story that drifted — and what that drift reveals about the primitive underneath.

#### The Original Promise: Better Than Financing

The consórcio began as a genuinely attractive alternative to traditional bank lending. In a country where the Selic rate currently sits at 15% per year and mortgage financing rates run 11--12% annually on top of inflation correction, the consórcio offered something structurally different: no interest, only a fixed administration fee unaffected by Selic movements. For a R\$200,000 real estate credit, the total administration fee runs 15--20% of the credit value spread across the contract — dramatically cheaper than compound interest over the same period, where the equivalent financing could cost 60--100% more in total outlay.

With ticket sizes routinely in the hundreds of thousands of reais across real estate and vehicle segments, and central bank oversight lending it legal legitimacy, the consórcio became something informal ROSCAs could never be: a regulated financial instrument that competes directly with bank lending. Brazil took a tool of social survival — the circle communities built to function without access to banks — and turned it into an instrument of high finance.

This advantage is real. From January to April 2025 alone, new consórcio enrolments grew 19.1% year-on-year, with the real estate segment up 41%. The market expects to surpass 11 million active participants in 2026 with 25% segment growth. But cheaper than financing in Brazil is a low bar. And the comparison conceals a misalignment that is foundational: the administration fee is paid in full regardless of when you are contemplated. Contemplated in month two or month 118 of a 120-month plan, you pay the same total fee. The fee structure rewards the administradora identically whether it serves you early or late.

#### The Auction Mechanic: A Sophistication That Left Ordinary Members Behind

The original ROSCA logic distributes lump-sum access through rotation — every member receives the pool once, timing determined by lot or agreed sequence. The consórcio preserved this through its monthly sorteio (lottery draw). The sorteio is the cooperative spirit in its purest form: you win by luck, not by wealth. Every member has an equal chance at early access regardless of capital.

But the consórcio added a second contemplation path: the lance, a competitive bid auction held alongside each monthly assembly. Any member can offer a lance — a percentage of the credit value — to win early contemplation over the sorteio. The highest bidder wins.

The lance is, in its own way, a genuine financial innovation — and precisely the feature that explains how the consórcio scaled to 6% of Brazilian GDP. It allows urgent capital needs to be met without waiting on luck. It turns the group mechanism into something that competes with credit markets on their own terms. Informal ROSCAs cannot do this. The Banco Central can regulate this. The lance is the sophistication that made the consórcio a serious financial instrument.

It is also the feature that broke the solidarity logic. The structural benefit that gave ROSCAs their purpose — giving everyone equal access to lump-sum capital in turn — became purchasable by those who already had capital. The wealthiest participant in the circle gets the money first. Every month. Indefinitely. The sorteio remains. But for anyone who can afford to bid, it is merely a fallback.

The lance embutido added further complexity. This mechanism lets members bid using part of their own carta de crédito as the offer — a member with a R\$100,000 carta can offer a 30% embedded lance of R\$30,000 to accelerate contemplation, receiving only R\$70,000 when contemplated. The intent was to democratise auction access for members without large capital reserves. The effect was a new layer of opaque calculation: participants must weigh reducing their effective credit against accelerating contemplation, based on group dynamics they cannot fully observe. The instrument grew more sophisticated. The ordinary saver fell further behind.

#### The Secondary Market: From Savings to Speculation

Once institutionalised, the consórcio developed a secondary market for cotas — quota positions — that transformed the product entirely. A contemplated cota commands a premium called ágio. In practice, the ágio on a recently contemplated quota runs 25--35% of the credit value in early group months, declining as the group matures. A R\$200,000 carta contemplada might be sold on the secondary market for R\$40,000--R\$70,000 in entry premium, with the buyer assuming remaining installment obligations.

This spawned an entire class of consórcio strategists — consultants selling strategies for leveraging net worth through coordinated quota acquisition, contemplation timing, and secondary market arbitrage. These strategies are rational for those who know them. They are completely invisible to ordinary participants, and they extract from the group pool in ways that ordinary members neither understand nor consent to.

By 2025, the consórcio system issued over 5.16 million new quotas in a single year. It is no longer a community savings tool. It is an institutionalised credit market using rotating pool mechanics as its legal structure, with secondary markets, strategic arbitrage, and information asymmetries that systematically favour sophisticated actors over ordinary ones.

| *The consórcio is not a failure. It is a drift. What began as a savings primitive — no interest, equal access, community-governed — became the most significant credit instrument in Brazil, regulated by the Banco Central and processing over $100 billion a year. That is a genuine achievement. But the carta de crédito is not your savings returned — it is credit extended against future obligations. The lance is not democratised access — it is the auction of the one thing ROSCAs were built to distribute equally. The community lost ownership of the mechanism. The institution gained it. This is the pattern Mandinga Protocol is built not to repeat.* |

### 1.5 Brazil as the Experimentation Layer

Brazil offers something unique for what comes next: a population of 200 million people who have already demonstrated they will adopt new financial technology at scale — if it genuinely serves them.

PIX — Brazil's instant payment system — launched in November 2020 and reached 100 million users within two years. By 2023, it processed more transactions than credit and debit cards combined, became the dominant payment method for the informal economy, and was adopted voluntarily by people who had never had a bank account. No payment system in history reached this scale this fast.

PIX is significant not because it is technologically remarkable — it is a government-operated clearing layer, not a blockchain. It is significant because it demonstrates that Brazil is not a late adopter of financial technology. It is a first adopter when the technology actually reduces friction for the people it claims to serve.

The consórcio, with its 10 million active participants and centuries of cultural precedent, is the other half of this picture. Brazil already has a population that understands rotating savings. They know what a circle is. They have experienced both what works — the rotation mechanic, the absence of interest, the solidarity logic — and what was captured — the lance that made timing purchasable by capital, the administradora's opacity, the ágio premium that systematically enriches sophisticated actors at ordinary members' expense.

Brazil is the right place to prove that a savings circle can be made trustless, yield-bearing, and genuinely fair. Not because it lacks financial infrastructure. Because it has the cultural vocabulary, the scale, and the demonstrated willingness to adopt financial technology that actually works.

This is the experimentation layer.

### 1.6 The Failure Mode Was Never Fixed; It Was Replicated

Whether a ROSCA fails informally through organiser fraud, or institutionally through auction mechanics and secondary market opacification, the root cause is the same: someone outside the group holds power that should belong to the collective. The circle breaks not because cooperative logic is flawed, but because an institution introduced single points of control that the cooperative logic was never designed to accommodate.

Every structural fix attempted by institutions reproduces the problem it claims to solve. Reputation systems gate access on identity and credit history. Auction mechanics gate timing on capital. Secondary market transfers gate continuity on administradora approval. Legal enforcement gates dispute resolution on jurisdictional access. Each intervention extends institutional sovereignty over a mechanism whose power derived precisely from operating outside institutional sovereignty.

### 1.7 DeFi Has Not Solved This Either

Decentralised finance has produced remarkable infrastructure for yield, lending, and capital markets. But it has not produced a savings primitive for ordinary people. The reasons are structural:

-   Yield-bearing stablecoins with competitive real-world rates require KYC gating at the issuance layer — tokenised treasuries are accessible only to professional clients and licensed resellers.

-   Genuinely permissionless DeFi yield (sDAI, Aave, Compound) derives from crypto-native sources — borrowing demand, protocol incentives — that are volatile and collapse in downturns.

-   Undercollateralised lending in DeFi requires either identity exposure or reputation scoring — both of which recreate surveillance-based access control.

-   Governance is token-weighted — one dollar one vote — which means financial influence is proportional to wealth, the opposite of cooperative logic.

Most critically: DeFi has never built a solidarity primitive. Every existing protocol is designed around individual financial maximisation. There is no primitive whose success metric is community resilience, whose risk model is mutualized, or whose governance has structural limits on financial influence.

| *Billions of people lack access to the single most powerful savings tool available: lump-sum capital deployed early enough to compound meaningfully. The mechanisms that historically provided this — savings circles, credit unions, ROSCAs, consórcios — have either broken on the organiser as single point of failure, or been institutionally captured and transfigured into credit products that recreate the inequality and opacity they were built to escape. DeFi has not built the infrastructure to fix this. The world needs a savings primitive that stays a savings primitive.* |

## 2. The Principles

Mandinga Protocol is built on four principles that define every design decision. Together they answer the question: what would it mean to genuinely improve a financial primitive, instead of capturing it?

### Improving

The consórcio mechanic is not wrong. It is unfinished. The rotation logic is sound — every member contributes, every member receives the pool in turn, and the timing advantage is distributed rather than concentrated. What broke was the layer built on top of it: the auction, the administradora, the opaque fee structure, the secondary market. Mandinga improves the underlying primitive while refusing to replicate what corrupted it. No auction. No organiser. No opacity. The rotation logic, done properly.

### Exporting

What works in Brazil — the circle mechanic, the solidarity logic, the cultural preference for community-based savings — should not stay in Brazil. The consórcio was geographically and institutionally constrained from the moment it was formalised. The blockchain layer is the export mechanism: a savings circle built on-chain operates across borders, currencies, time zones, and jurisdictions without requiring any of them to be aligned. The communities that invented the ROSCA in every culture, independently, can now participate in a single primitive governed by the same logic.

### Approximating

A perfect circle requires perfect matching — every member with exactly the same installment amount, exactly the same duration, at exactly the same moment. Perfect matching rarely happens. The protocol approximates the ideal: it forms the best possible circle from available intent, not waiting for exact alignment that may never come. When enough people declare similar enough parameters, the kickoff algorithm closes the circle. Members who are slightly outside the best group receive suggestions to adjust their parameters and join a better match. The protocol continuously narrows the gap between intent and formation.

### Splitting

The fundamental act of a savings circle is splitting. A larger amount — the pool — is split into installments that a community of savers can sustain. Those installments, paid consistently over time, are what make the circle possible. Mandinga starts here: not with how much you want, but with how much you can put away, and for how long. That split defines your circle. The installment is the product.

## 3. The Philosophy: Solidarity, Not Charity

Mandinga Protocol is built on a distinction that matters: the difference between charity and solidarity.

  ----------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  **Charity Logic**                         **Solidarity Logic**

  Hierarchical — donors on top            Horizontal — mutual aid between equals

  Sustained by the goodwill of donors       Sustained by mutual interdependence

  Decisions made by boards and funders      Decisions made by the community

  Treats symptoms of inequality             Addresses root causes by building alternatives

  Success = amount donated, number served   Success = self-determination, reduced inequality

  Disconnected donations                    Community-owned infrastructure
  ----------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------

Charity DeFi would give yield to the poor as a subsidy. Solidarity DeFi gives everyone the structural mechanism to access lump-sum capital on equal terms, governed by the community, with surplus flowing back to members.

This maps directly onto the Defipunk values articulated by the Ethereum Foundation: finance that is permissionless, censorship-resistant, privacy-first, self-custodial, and open source. Not finance that is marginally better than TradFi — finance that could not exist without Ethereum.

The three principles that guide every design decision in Mandinga Protocol are:

-   Mutualized risk: when a member faces difficulty, the circle responds collectively, not algorithmically.

-   Structural enforcement over surveillance: the protocol enforces correct behaviour through incentive design, not identity tracking or permanent reputation marks.

-   Governance with limits on financial influence: participation rights are not proportional to deposits. The cooperative surplus flows to all members, not to the largest holders.

## 4. The Solution: Mandinga Protocol

### 4.1 The Savings Account: Your Base Layer

Every member begins with a self-custodial savings account. Deposit a dollar-stable asset and it starts earning yield immediately — automatically routed to yield-generating sources and compounding without any management on your part.

The savings account is the foundation. All features of Mandinga Protocol sit on top of it. You can use the savings account alone and it will quietly compound for you. The savings circle is an optional feature you activate when you are ready.

### 4.2 The Savings Circle: Start With What You Can Afford

The question is not *how much do you want?* It is *how much can you put away, and for how long?*

A member activates the savings circle feature by answering those two questions:

- **Installment**: how much can I contribute per period? (e.g., \$50 a month)
- **Duration**: for how long? (e.g., 12 months)

That is the entire input. From those two declarations, the protocol finds other people who can contribute the same amount over the same period. When enough matching intents exist, a circle forms. The pool — the amount each selected member receives — is the installment multiplied by the circle size. Nobody declared that number. It emerged from the match.

The member selected first earns yield on the full pool from that moment. The member selected last earns yield on their installments alone. The rotation distributes the timing advantage — the structural benefit that previously required wealth to access — across all members equally over a full cycle. Every member receives the pool exactly once. No auctions. No bids. Verifiable on-chain randomness determines the order.

| *Ten members each contributing \$100 a month create a \$1,000 pool. The member selected in round one earns yield on \$1,000 from that moment. The member selected in round ten earns yield on \$100 for nine months, then \$1,000 for one month. The gap between these two outcomes is the yield leverage premium — the structural advantage that previously required wealth to access, now distributed by rotation.* |

#### The Minimum Installment: A Built-In Safety Net

Every installment has a floor. When joining a circle, a member can declare a minimum installment — the amount they can guarantee in any circumstances, even a difficult month. The default minimum is half the full installment.

If a member can only pay the minimum in a given round, the Safety Net Pool covers the difference. The circle does not pause. The member stays in. But from that moment, the member pays interest on the covered portion — a small, transparent fee that flows to the Safety Net Pool depositors who made the coverage possible.

This option can be elected in two ways:

- **At the start**: a member can declare upfront that they will use the minimum installment from day one. They pay interest on the covered half from the first round.
- **When needed**: a member pays full installments until they hit a difficult period, then activates the minimum option. Interest begins from that round.

This is not a loan. There is no credit check, no application, no approval. It is a structural feature of the circle: the Safety Net Pool holds capital specifically to enable this coverage, and the interest paid is the fair price for that capacity. The circle continues. The member's position is maintained. When they are selected, the debt is settled automatically from the payout before their net obligation is locked.

#### Enforcement Without Surveillance

The installment is an obligation — but enforcement is structural, not punitive. The minimum commitment is always half the installment: the Safety Net Pool covers the other half, so the amount any member is ever required to pay in a difficult round is exactly half of what they declared when joining.

The enforcement is architectural: the installment must be met each round, at minimum its covered half. There is no requirement to hold a specific balance at all times, no credit check, no identity tracking, and no permanent record. The only requirement is to pay the minimum when the round arrives — and the pool always stands ready to cover the rest.

A member can also opt out of the Savings Circle feature entirely at any time. When they do, no further installments are owed and the contributions already paid are returned to their savings account. The savings account continues compounding. The Savings Circle can be reactivated whenever they are ready.

**What happens if you cannot pay even half?**

This is a real scenario. Life happens. Before anything else, the protocol surfaces a question: is there a smaller installment you can sustain?

If yes — the protocol reallocates. The member moves to a smaller circle matching what they can actually afford. Their previous contributions transfer into the reallocation rather than returning to the savings account. The circle they leave may briefly carry a slightly smaller pool; the protocol works to bring in a replacement whose installment and remaining duration fit the open position, using the Safety Net Pool where needed. For the remaining members, the experience is minimal: a temporarily smaller pool while the replacement joins, then continuity. The circle is not broken. It is corrected.

If no — there is no installment, however small, that the member can commit to right now. The Savings Circle feature turns off. No more installments are owed. The contributions already paid are returned to the member's savings account, minus any debt owed to the Safety Net Pool for coverage already received. The member's obligation ends cleanly. The Savings Circle can be reactivated whenever they are ready.

You do not lose the money you put in. The design corrects, not punishes.

### 4.3 The Safety Net Pool: Making the Safety Net Possible

The Safety Net Pool is how the minimum installment option exists. Members with idle savings capacity deposit capital into the pool, lock it for a declared duration, and earn yield on it — the same yield their capital would earn in a standalone savings account. In exchange, that capital backs circle participants who need minimum installment coverage.

The return for pool depositors is straightforward: base yield on their locked capital, plus the interest paid by covered members. The risk is minimal: the coverage is always bounded by the installment amount, and the debt is always settled when the covered member receives their payout.

The Safety Net Pool is also the mechanism that eliminates the entry barrier entirely. A member does not need a large balance to join a circle. They need to be able to pay the minimum installment. The pool covers the gap until their savings build to full installment capacity.

### 4.4 Two Participation Strategies

  --------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  **Active Circle Participation**         **Safety Net Pool Deposit**

  Join a circle matched to your installment   Deposit idle capital into the pool

  Receive full pool payout when selected   Earn base yield plus interest from covered members

  Higher upside when selected early       Lower upside, diversified across many circles

  Capital tied to circle duration, redeemable on opt-out   Capital available to redeploy as circles complete

  Maximises personal yield leverage       Amplifies others' access while generating passive return
  --------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

The Safety Net Pool is not simply a financial instrument. It encodes the core principle of the cooperative model: those who have more capacity can amplify the access of those building toward capacity, and both benefit from the arrangement.

## 5. User Flows and Real Use Cases

### 5.1 Amara — Lagos, Nigeria

*Amara is a seamstress. She earns inconsistently but saves deliberately. She has never had a bank account that paid meaningful interest, and she has participated in a local ajo (rotating savings circle) for years — but the organiser disappeared with the pot two years ago. She lost three months of contributions.*

Amara deposits \$120 into Mandinga Protocol using a mobile wallet. Her savings account immediately begins earning yield.

She activates the savings circle feature. The protocol asks: how much can you put away each month? She enters \$12. For how long? Ten months. The protocol finds nine other people with matching intent and forms a circle. The pool is \$120 — \$12 multiplied by ten members.

In round three, Amara is selected. Her savings position shows \$120. She watches it compound at the full pool rate. Over the following seven rounds, her installment obligations are satisfied automatically from her balance. There is no organiser. The protocol is the organiser.

She knows her income can be unpredictable, so she elected the minimum installment option at the start. On months when she can, she pays the full \$12. On difficult months, she pays \$6 and the Safety Net Pool covers the rest. A small interest charge appears in her position display — transparent, fair, and automatically settled when she receives her payout.

### 5.2 Rafael — São Paulo, Brazil

*Rafael is a delivery driver. He joined a motorcycle consórcio with a R\$15,000 carta de crédito, paying R\$280/month. He is in month 19 of a 60-month group. He has not been contemplated. He has watched other members win contemplation through lances he could not match. He has calculated that at his current pace, he will likely be contemplated somewhere between month 35 and 50 — and will have paid the full administration fee regardless of when that happens.*

A friend tells him about Mandinga Protocol. He is sceptical — he associates crypto with speculation and volatility, not savings.

What changes his mind is the framing: *how much can you put away each month? For how long?* Rafael knows exactly what he can afford — he has been paying R\$280 a month for 19 months. He converts the equivalent of his monthly installment to a dollar-stable asset and activates the savings circle feature. The protocol matches him to a circle of similar intent.

Selection is by verifiable lottery. There is no lance mechanic. There is no auction. No one in the circle can purchase earlier access. In round six, Rafael is selected. His position jumps to the full pool value. He watches yield accrue on the larger amount.

Rafael is still in his original consórcio. It will eventually deliver a carta de crédito. But for his next vehicle, he will not use a consórcio. The bar was never *cheaper than financing*. The bar is: does the mechanism serve me, or does it serve the institution?

### 5.3 Sofia — Buenos Aires, Argentina

*Sofia is a software developer with \$3,000 saved in dollar-stable assets. Argentina's inflation has taught her not to hold local currency. She wants stable yield without KYC requirements she does not trust.*

Sofia deposits into Mandinga Protocol. She participates actively in circles for two cycles, experiencing the yield leverage mechanic firsthand.

In her third year, she shifts strategy. She deposits a portion of her savings into the Safety Net Pool, locking it for twelve months. Her capital earns the same yield it would in her savings account. But it also enables minimum installment coverage for circle participants who need it — and she earns the interest they pay on the covered portion.

Sofia now earns passive income while her capital amplifies the access of people who would otherwise be excluded from larger circles. This is not charity. It is mutualized solidarity — structured as a market.

### 5.4 A Diaspora Community — Coordinated Across Borders

*A family network spans three countries: members in Nairobi, London, and Toronto. They have historically coordinated a family chama using WhatsApp and informal trust. Twice in the last decade, members have defaulted on contributions. The emotional and financial cost to the group was significant.*

The family moves their circle to Mandinga Protocol. Each member declares how much they can put away and for how long. The protocol forms their circle. The rotation operates automatically across three time zones, three currencies (all bridged to dollar-stable assets at entry), and three jurisdictions.

The family has no organiser. They have a protocol. The social trust that made the original chama work is preserved — they chose each other, they know each other. But the structural vulnerability that broke it twice has been removed.

## 6. What Makes This Defipunk

The Ethereum Foundation's test for Defipunk DeFi is whether the thing could exist without Ethereum. Mandinga Protocol fails this test in the best possible way: it cannot exist anywhere else.

-   Could it exist on traditional banking rails? No. Banks require identity, report to credit bureaus, are geographically constrained, and extract surplus for shareholders.

-   Could it exist as a standard DAO? No. DAOs are token-weighted and fully transparent. Full transparency destroys the social grace that makes cooperative savings work.

-   Could it exist with a centralised yield manager? No. A human treasurer recreates the single point of failure that makes ROSCAs break.

-   Could the privacy layer exist on a standard public blockchain? No. Public ledgers would expose every member's balance and contribution history to the world, permanently and irreversibly.

-   Could the Safety Net Pool exist without decentralised enforcement? No. Coverage requires trustless structural guarantees that the backed position cannot be withdrawn while it is active.

Mandinga Protocol is also specifically aligned with the Ethereum Foundation's Defipunk criteria:

-   Permissionless access: anyone can interact with the core contracts without KYC or whitelisting.

-   Self-custody: users maintain custody at all times. The protocol holds principal in trust during circle participation, but withdrawal mechanics are enforced by code, not by a custodian.

-   Open source: all contract code is FLOSS-licensed and publicly auditable.

-   Privacy by default: balances, contribution history, and circle membership are shielded. The public ledger sees only cryptographic proofs of valid participation.

-   Governance with limits on financial influence: cooperative governance applies equal weight to all members regardless of deposit size. Protocol-level decisions are separated from circle-level decisions, each with appropriate governance scope.

-   Minimised oracle reliance: yield routing uses decentralised, manipulation-resistant oracle infrastructure for real-world rate data. The protocol is designed to continue functioning if any single data source fails.

## 7. The Broader Vision

Mandinga Protocol is not a stablecoin. It is not a yield aggregator. It is not a lending protocol. It is a new category: a permissionless savings primitive — infrastructure that encodes cooperative financial logic into immutable, permissionless code.

The success metric is not TVL. It is not APY. It is the number of people who accessed the compounding advantage earlier than they could have alone, the number of circles that completed without failure, and the degree to which financial access expanded to people previously excluded from any meaningful savings infrastructure.

The vision is a world where the ancient practice of community savings — the mechanism that has helped hundreds of millions of people build financial stability for millennia — is finally free from its structural vulnerabilities. Where a seamstress in Lagos, a delivery driver in São Paulo who knows exactly what a consórcio costs and why the bar should be higher, a developer in Buenos Aires, and a diaspora family across three continents can all participate in the same permissionless savings primitive, governed by the same cooperative logic, with the same privacy protections, and the same structural guarantees.

Finance that couldn't exist without Ethereum. Finance that the world has been trying to build for thousands of years and never quite could. Until now.
